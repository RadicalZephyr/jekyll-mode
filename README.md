jekyll-mode
===========

A set of utilitiies for writing a jekyll blog using emacs

This may evolve into something more interesting in the future, but for
now it's just a new post function.

### Wishlist:

- A minor-mode for allowing Jekyll commands to be run seamlessly from
  anywhere in the project. android-mode is a great example of what I
  want
- Some small modifications to markdown-mode to make it more Jekyll
  aware
  - Make Liquid tags un-fillable
